    Comments:
    - The flow appears to be little up , in the engine , so probably there must be some leftovers.
    - It needs to be filled very little each time, make some bubbles to suck the fluid, and fill again as much as the radiator cap area can take.
    - I can not be filled by the overflow tank.
    - The overflow does not change level, need to check radiator pressure.
    - It had white salt deposits undfer the  cap.
